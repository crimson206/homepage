# My First Steps into Coding

Today I decided to start learning web development. It's exciting to see how a few lines of HTML and CSS can create something visual in the browser.

## What I've learned so far:
- HTML provides the structure
- CSS handles the styling  
- JavaScript adds interactivity

The journey has just begun, but I'm already amazed by what's possible. Looking forward to building more complex projects soon!
